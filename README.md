# Mario 64

Welcome to my Unreal Engine project, inspired by the classic Mario 64 game! I followed along with the Epic Games community tutorial [here](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/courses/kna/hour-of-code-unreal-engine-build-your-first-3d-game/0b8a/hour-of-code-unreal-engine-create-your-first-3d-game) to kickstart my journey into game development using Unreal Engine.

### Key Features:
